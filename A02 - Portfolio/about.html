    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Born in Kuala Lumpur, raised in Ipoh. I am very determined and hardworking towards my goals. During my high school days, I thrived balancing my academic and co-curricular. I received 3 awards from being a Girl Guide and one of them is Queen's Guide. After high school, I continued my studies taking foundation in Engineering at UITM Dengkil.</p>
    <p>I decided to take computer science because getting into the IT field for my career would be demanding in the future. Before making the decision, I decided to take computing subjects during my foundation studies to see if I’m really into it. Yes, I was right, so computer science courses were in my UPU list. Now, I’ve secured my choice. I want to be a DevOps engineer in the future.</p>

    <h1>"Now or Never"</h1>
    <p>My favorite quote is 'Now or Never.' It reminds me that the present moment is the most important time to take action. I believe that waiting for the 'perfect' time often leads to missed opportunities. This quote motivates me to push past fear and hesitation, urging me to make decisions and pursue my goals without delay. It’s a reminder that the future is shaped by the choices we make today, and that procrastination only leads to regret.</p>
    <p>This quote resonates with me because it challenges the tendency to overthink or wait for ideal circumstances. It pushes me to embrace the uncertainty of life and to trust in my ability to adapt and grow from any situation. I’ve found that when I act in the moment, even if the outcome is uncertain, I often learn more and achieve more than I would have by holding back. </p>

      <h1>My strengths</h1>
      <p>One of my key strengths is my independence. I am highly self-sufficient and can take charge of tasks and challenges with minimal supervision. This ability allows me to efficiently manage my time, make decisions on my own, and maintain focus on achieving my goals. Whether it’s working on projects, solving complex problems, or navigating through new environments, I am confident in my ability to handle situations by myself.</p>
      <p>eing able to rely on myself in any setting gives me a strong sense of empowerment and helps me grow both personally and professionally, always pushing me to be self-reliant while building my problem-solving skills.</p>
